## Getting Started

Make sure to go through this list to have a smooth start. Feel free to start with the docs at `https://vue-bridge.dev` or come back to it whenever you need it.


- [ ] Install dependencies by running `pnpm i`. Not using pnpm yet? Get started at https://pnpm.io
- [ ] Give this monorepo a proper name, description and your author details (`/package.json`)
- [ ] Give your packages a proper name, description and your author details (`/lib-vueX/package.json`)
- [ ] Add your name to the LICENSE files in the root folder as well as the package folders (`/lib-*`)
- [ ] Run `pnpm build-all` and inspect the build output in `/lib-vue3/dist(-vue2)`. Take a look at the package exports to get a picture of what's being exported by your package.
